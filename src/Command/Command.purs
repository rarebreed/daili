-- | A module that handles a lot of the ugliness of asynchronous programming when calling a subprocess
-- | using the purescript-node-child-process module.  The problem with the purescript child process module is that it
-- | doesn't use Aff, and it doesn't handle the scenario where you have a dependency chain of calling several commands
-- | in a row or of saving the output of a command.
-- |
-- | The code here looks and is very mutable.  Part of the reason for that is because the onData function in purescript
-- | and in node has to take a callback which returns nothing (Unit).  This is a problem because how can we save any
-- | data?  That means we have to use a Ref or STRef (or maybe a Writer monad) to accumulate the data.  Moreover, this
-- | is a problem for callbacks.  The onExit function has the same problem.

-- asynchronous launch.  Ok, this was super confusing.  makeAff takes a function that takes two callbacks, one for
-- error handling, and the other for success and returns Eff e Unit.  What was super confusing to me is how you actually
-- passed the callbacks.  So in the example below, if I call launch, how do I actually pass in the error and success
-- handlers?  That is what runAff is for.  What is still confusing to me though is what if my asynchronous computation
-- needs multiple handlers?  Like for example copyFile (which uses readFile that takes a handler, and writeFile that
-- also takes its own handler)?
